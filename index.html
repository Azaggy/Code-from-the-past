<h2 id="early">Before my Depression Surfaced</h2>
<h3>
That was me when I was younger. I always was ready for anything. I was also adopted when I was only four months old. My name is Anamaria Maya Rigaberta Mendoza Velasquez Zaggy. I am 1/3 Mayan Indian, 1/3 Hispanic, and 1/3 Latina. I was born in San Juan De Dios Hospital in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The family that I had ended up living with for my childhood was called the Zaggy family. My adoptive mom and dad already had three sons.I grew up fairly normal, well as normal as I could. I was the average child, outgoing, happy, interested in everything and how it works. I wanted to take on the world with just my brain and body. I went through Elementary School just like every child, then moved on to middle school. That is when my life started to go down hill and my struggle started.</h3>

<h2 id="begin">The Down Hill Tumble</h2>
<h3>
I just entered a new school and I knew no one at the school. I was the outsider of everyone, because they had all known each other since Preschool. I was at Christ the King. I started to move off my intended path and start to steer clear of any interaction with anyone. I hated myself. I hated how people treated me. I was ugly. I never thought that I could be loved. I had been emotionally abused by the one person who I trusted the most, my dad... Yet I kept all my emotions in and it was too much. I wanted to erase that pain, but I had no one I trusted who I could talk to about my feelings. Then one day, I accidently injured myself. While I was looking at my wound, I felt an immediate release of everything, because all I cared about was the blood flowing out of my arm. It was then that I realized, this is my solution. I can use my physical pain to max out my mental pain. I started to cut, but not with a knife. I cut my own skin with my own thumbnail. I still have the marks that are curved on my arm. It was the best release that I had in a long time. Soon, I was cutting everyday and it wasn't enough. SO I started to bite my arm. Sometimes so hard that I would lose a little feeling in my fingers or hand. I was able to hide it by wearing bracelets, or long sleeves. I specifically remember, one day I did not cover up my scabs and scars, and some kids in my 7th grade classpicked on me for it, which just motivated me to go into the bathroom and cover up my scars, as well as make a few more scars. Even when I meet, what I thought was the love of my life on March 21, 2010, I continued to cut. It only got worse...</h3>

<h2 id="during">My Struggle</h2>
<h3> I had no standards, if anyone paid me attention, I went for them. I grew in weight at this time. I ate all the time and my confidence went downhill. The suposed love of my life never made it better. I thought he cared for me, but all it brought was distruction and more hatred towards myself. Whether it was him breaking up with me every month, or him putting down my looks or telling me how to look and dress. It took almost three years for me to realize that he was abusive towards me, maybe not physically, but emotionally. I learned later on that all the abuse that I had put up with between this one guy and my own father, was what drove me to harm myself. I was told from middle school that I will never amount to anything. I was told this so often that I had started to believe it and I hated myself for it. I let my grades drop, and I started to not care at all about my life or future. The only thing that gave me pleasure was my artwork.

<h2 id="hidden">Hidden Emotions</h2>
<h3>
With my artwork become darker and darker, I started to conceal my feelings more and more. It felt like I had no feelings and had no care about who I hurt or what I did. Currently, I do miss my distant emotions, because I dont get hurt as easily. The fact of the matter was that I was mentally and emotionally killing myself.
</h3>
<h3>
I was attacked by a dog and it saved my life. It was New Years Day and I went over to my friends house. I got too close to a chained up dog and he was able to grip my throat and my right arm. I was able to get out of his grip, but I was very lucky. If that Pit Bull/ Mastive Mix had gone an centimeter in either direction or deeper, then I would not be here to write this web page.
